Django Follow Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern Architecture

Django follows the MVT (Model-View-Template) architectural pattern, which is a variation of the traditional MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern. 


# MVT (Model-View-Template)
What it is A design pattern, very similar to MVC, that also splits an app into three parts: the data (Model), the logic that handles requests (View), and the user interface (Template).

# MVC (Model-View-Controller)
What it is A design pattern that splits an application into three connected parts: the data (Model), the user interface (View), and the logic that handles user input (Controller).

>>django-admin startproject 'project_name'

open Directory in Terminal 
1.Create an Virtual Env
>>python -m venv venv
>>venv\Scripts\activate

2.install django in correct Directory
>>pip install django

3.run Python project
>>python manage.py runserver

4.App creation So 
>>python manage.py startapp 'app_name'

5.In that App file You need to go to Url.py file Instead of admin view we need to change view and urls
from django.urls import path, include
from django.contrib import admin
from salary_prediction import views
urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='home'),
    path('about', views.about, name='about')
    
]

then in views.py\
from django.shortcuts import render,HttpResponse


# Create your views here.
def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, world. You're at the salary prediction index.")
def about(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, world. You're at the salary prediction about page.")

6.Static and Template
Created Static and Template So now we need to tell django that for Static go to Static folder and for Template in Template file

7.setting
So in setting  we need to import os 
in installed app:
    'salary_prediction.apps.SalaryPredictionConfig',
and for Templetes:
    'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')]
and for Static create new:
    'STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')]
